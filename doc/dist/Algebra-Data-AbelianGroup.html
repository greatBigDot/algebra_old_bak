 Haskell typeclass. Abelian groups are simply groups (see <code><a href="Algebra-Data-Group.html#t:Group" title="Algebra.Data.Group">Group</a></code> in
 <a href="Algebraic-Data-Group.html">Algebraic.Data.Group</a>) with the extra condition that the binary operation
 must be abelian (that is, commutative).</p><p>Formally, an abelian group is a 4-tuple
 \(\mathscr{G} = (G : \mathscr{V}, + : G^2 \to G, 0 : G, - : G \to G)\)
 satisfying the following axioms:</p><ul><li>\((G, +, 0, -)\) forms a group</li><li>\(x + y = y + x\)</li></ul><p>You may have noticed that the notation here differs from the one presented
 for groups---here, the plus sign is used as the operation (and zero as the
 identity), while for more general groups, the multiplication symbol was used
 (and one as the identity). This is intentional. The class of abelian groups
 has rather different behavior, arising in different situations, than groups.
 At first this fact may be a surprise, but the commutativity axiom is actually
 quite strong, especially in the context of groups. Remember, a natural way to
 think of groups is that they model symmetries---that is, invertible
 composable mappings from an object to itself. In general, for <em>functions</em> to
 be commutative with respect to composition is a very special property;
 reversing the order of two transformations will typically yield different
 results. E.g., rotating a polygon, then flipping it over; or squaring a
 number, then adding 5. Flipping the order in which these are applied
 &quot;typically&quot; changes the outcome. In abelian groups, however, <em>every</em> pair of
 transformations must yield the same outcome as applying them in other
 directions. This suggests that viewing them as &quot;symmetries&quot; might not be the
 best way to think of abelian groups. You can see more discussion of this idea
 over at MathOverflow, a Q&amp;A site for professional mathematicians:
 <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/2551/">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/2551/</a></p><p>Abelian groups are important in algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is,
 roughly speaking, the study of systems of multivariate polynomial equations.
 An important idea is that of an &quot;algebraic variety&quot;, which is essentially the
 intersection of the roots of a set of multivariate polynomials. For example,
 a circle with radius \(r\) and center \((h,k)\) is an algebraic variety,
 being the zero of the 2-variable polynomial \((x-h)^2+(y-k)^2-r^2\). In this
 framework, one can formulate and pursue various interesting ideas---e.g., a
 generalization of the fundamental theorem of algebra to higher dimensions, a
 result known as B&#233;zout's Theorem. Anyways, as it turns out, a certain
 subset of algebraic varietites, known as &quot;abelian varieties&quot;, form an abelian
 group. That is, the points comprising the variety are the group elements, and
 using the tools of algebraic geometry one can define a natural group
 operation obeying the group laws that is always commutative. As it turns out,
 this idea is central to modern cryptography.</p><p>Another branch of mathematics where abelian groups shine is category theory.
 Categories, among many other things, abstracts abstract algebra. For example,
 there is a category of groups, which consists of all groups and all the
 homomorphisms between them (that is, functions preserving the group
 operations). Category theory is a very useful and interesting branch of math;
 it simultaneously generalizes many disprate ideas and introduces many new
 interesting questions of its own. Also, in a very pleasing and fun way, it
 abstracts itself---there is a category of categories. (Though, that last idea
 must be treated with utmost care to avoid set-theoretic Russel's
 paradox--esque issues; to bypass most of them, you can just consider the
 category of &quot;small&quot; categories.) The category of abelian groups exhibits
 various special properties that are useful in the study of categories in
 general. As such, a subset of categories known as &quot;abelian categories&quot; have
 been defined, with the category of abelian groups being the motivating
 example.</p></div></div><div id="synopsis"><details id="syn"><summary>Synopsis</summary><ul class="details-toggle" data-details-id="syn"><li class="src short"><span class="keyword">class</span> <a href="Algebra-Data-Group.html#t:Group" title="Algebra.Data.Group">Group</a> g =&gt; <a href="#t:AbelianGroup">AbelianGroup</a> g <span class="keyword">where</span><ul class="subs"></ul></li></ul></details></div><div id="interface"><h1>Documentation</h1><div class="top"><p class="src"><span class="keyword">class</span> <a href="Algebra-Data-Group.html#t:Group" title="Algebra.Data.Group">Group</a> g =&gt; <a id="t:AbelianGroup" class="def">AbelianGroup</a> g <span class="keyword">where</span> <a href="src/Algebra.Data.AbelianGroup.html#AbelianGroup" class="link">Source</a> <a href="#t:AbelianGroup" class="selflink">#</a></p><div class="doc"><p>An <code><a href="Algebra-Data-AbelianGroup.html#t:AbelianGroup" title="Algebra.Data.AbelianGroup">AbelianGroup</a></code> is a type that is an instance of <code><a href="Algebra-Data-Group.html#t:Group" title="Algebra.Data.Group">Group</a></code> that also
